## Overview 

Sirhaana is a service that will serve the **urban poor,** address their **issue of handling emergencies** and **guide** them through. Sirhaana aims to bridge the gap between the present-day healthcare systems and the urban poor, who mostly prefer their home remedies or are unaware of the schemes they are eligible for. Sirhaana is a service that can have an impact and help people so that they are not turned away or taken advantage of because of their circumstances.

This project was selected as one of the **Top 16 FINALISTS** worldwide at the [Bay Area Global Health Innovation Challenge 2021](http://www.bayareaglobalhealthchallenge.com/2021-finalists) (oragnised by the **Bay Area Global Health Alliance** comprising of **UC Berkeley**, **Stanford University, UC Davis and** **UC SF**) after it was reviewed by a panel of expert reviewers in clinical medicine, the sciences, global development and business.

## Premise

It is [estimated](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/trends/Population2030.pdf) that by 2031, there would be around 600 million urban dwellers in India alone. And from our user study we realized that only 20.3% of the participants were actually aware of the common causes of prevalent illnesses and their prevention. 

> In India,Â **16,00,000** people die every year due to poor quality of care. Most of these happen because people neglect any issues till the **last possible moment** and donâ€™t trust the healthcare system.
> 

The Indian Government is soon planning to launch the **National Health Stack** under the [**National Digital Health Mission**](https://healthid.ndhm.gov.in/), which will **change** the way how Indians would access their healthcare services. 

But as has been the case with Covid-19 vaccination and even smartphone penetration, the poor would be the **last to get on this bandwagon** too. We saw both these issues as a huge gap and decided to do something about it. 

## Process

### Desk Research

We looked at the entire healthcare system in depth to understand its nuances.

### Interviews

With the urban poor, doctors and medical business owners.

### Questionnaires

Sent to doctors and students from an urban poor background to understand their opinions and hardships.

### Ideation

An iterative process between the research phase and interviews.

### System Map

Structuring of the service with a system map.

### Business Model

Came up with financial plan to support the implementation of the service using a business innovation canvas and a value proposition canvas.

## Major Insights

To our surprise, we found...

2. Long waiting lines in hospitals and the very confusing government policies.
3. Sub-par standards of treatment due to presence of inexperienced, unqualified doctors.
4. Generational lack of trust that is exaggerated by the problems mentioned above.
5. Home-makers try to put on a strong face and ignore health problems till they escalate to very serious points.
6. People put more faith in voodoo and black magic than medicine.

## Problem Statement

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ How might we get theÂ Indian Urban poor populationÂ involved into the healthcare system & PHR through convenient and accessible healthcare by leveraging the available technologies and humanizing the system.

*Personal Health Records(PHR) System is a part of the wider National Health Stack System.

## Our Solution

Sirhaana would be a free of cost service that would help establish trust and would connect the urban poor to the structured health care system with the help of the National Health Stack. 

The set-up,

![1. Sirhaana visits an urban dwelling, identifies the influential/respected members, major diseases and major first-aid requirements. ](/sirhaana/1.webp)

1. Sirhaana visits an urban dwelling, identifies the influential/respected members, major diseases and major first-aid requirements. 

![2. Sirhaana employs and trains the influential members as local respondents.(More emphasis is given to recruiting women for their empowerment)](/sirhaana/3.webp)

2. Sirhaana employs and trains the influential members as local respondents.(More emphasis is given to recruiting women for their empowerment)

1. The local respondents/partners of Sirhaana in the urban dwellings are then provided with a smart-kit, that includes a smartphone, important vitals checking machines and area specific first-aid kit. 

![4.The smartphone has a chat-bot that can help with the documentation of every person's health records. The Sirhaana partner also has access to a 24*7 helpline that will provide expert directions to the partner.](/sirhaana/4.webp)

Sirhaana in Action,

![1. A person is sick and calls the local respondent/partner immediately.](/sirhaana/7.webp)

1. A person is sick and calls the local respondent/partner immediately.

1. The local respondent quickly attends the person and calls the helpline, which helps it assess whether the case is an emergency or not and deals with necessary first aid. In case of an emergency, the helpline calls an ambulance and details of any prevalent conditions like diabetes, heart ailments(from the Personal Health Record of the person) are forwarded to the doctor who will attend the patient at the hospital through the helpline.  

![3. In case the situation is not serious, the local respondent takes to the chat-bot for information. The nearest hospital details are then forwarded. The vitals of the person are measured and are then input into the Personal Health Record of the person.](/sirhaana/8.webp)

3. In case the situation is not serious, the local respondent takes to the chat-bot for information. The nearest hospital details are then forwarded. The vitals of the person are measured and are then input into the Personal Health Record of the person.

![4. The person is taken to the nearest hospital for a checkup. The prescription is uploaded to the person's Personal Health Record.](/sirhaana/11.webp)

4. The person is taken to the nearest hospital for a checkup. The prescription is uploaded to the person's Personal Health Record.

1. The person then comes back home, the National Health Stack system is queried for the benefits that the person might be entitled to and dispenses the medicines either by home delivery or by creating an advance bill that can be availed at a drug store. 

Thus all **records of the person** are accurately stored in their Personal Health Records and there are reduced chances of them being exploited.
