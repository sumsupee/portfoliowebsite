## Overview

Assistive Switches can **improve learning outcomes** among children with motor disabilities. They can help reduce **learned helplessness** and thus are an essential aspect of their independence. Most of the assistive switches available in the market are very expensive. Even after being expensive they all are mostly wired. The wireless options are available at a premium price. Yet they rely on direct Bluetooth connections with the device and consume a lot of power requiring frequent charge cycles. This makes the assistive switch(also called an accessibility switch) **inaccessible for most users**. This project comes up with a **new** **solution** that modifies existing hardware(a computer mouse) into an assistive switch and can be made available to the end-users for less than a dollar or as a DIY product.

## The problem statement

The project had started with an aim to create a **wireless HID-compliant assistive switch** with a cost of production of less than 500 INR.

## User and Market Study

The assistive switch that we were creating was to be used with **electronic devices.** Assistive technology was a new field for everyone on the team but to understand more about assistive switches we contacted Dr Ruchi Dixit, the Founder and Director at Sankalp Pediatric Rehabilitation Centre Udaipur, who helped us with her expertise and experience of operating with assistive switches and the needs of children with special needs. 

Through our conversation, we realized that the children did not have **access** to assistive switches at **their homes** and their access to them was only restricted to the center. The center had a Big Buddy Switch and a contact-less ADITI switch from the CREATE Lab at IIT Madras. We came to know that the children did not receive an immediate reward or feedback from the contact-less switch and thus were not keen to use it.  

We also found out that the **prices** of assistive switches were just too much for the function that they were offering. Some parents found it easier to just **substitute** that amount of money for **purchasing voice assistants** like Google Home and Alexa that they could operate themselves for their children.

## Coming up with the solution

> Creating a **switch** that is truly **accessible**!
> 

Our process for coming up with the switch was iterative and constantly kept on jumping from one part to the other. They have been summarized in the graphic below. 

![Our Process](/jswitch/Final_Presentation(4).jpg)

## Our Process

During the ideation part of the process, we came up with the idea to use an already mass-manufactured device like the **computer mouse** instead of creating an entire switch from scratch. We had already come across single button switches that were replicating the left click of the mouse on the computer. So we decided to create an encasing for the mouse that can act as an accessibility switch. The encasing can be of different surface areas for different people and can be customized as per the need.

Using computer mice had the **following advantages**-

- They are **mass-manufactured**, branded wireless mice are available in the Indian market for as low as 250 INR
- They are built for **durability**, so can handle most human presses
- Mice buttons **produce a click sound** upon pressing to give feedback to the users
- Wireless mice last for months on a single battery/charge

We followed it up by looking at all the possible movements that we could incorporate with a click on the switch to design the encasings accordingly.

## Mock-ups and the solution

> **The Solution**: Customized skins/covers for mice that can convert any mouse wireless/wired to an assistive switch

All designs, finalized ones in black color, the rest in gray

These were the final drawings of the three encasings we had designed for the mouse. They were fabricated with cardboard and 'M-seal' and were tested by the team. Making all the prototypes cost us less than 50 INR. These were then tested along with the Logitech M170 wireless mouse.

## The Design File

Can be printed on A4 sheets and be made using cardboard. Detailed instructions on the website mentioned at the end.

 

![Assembly Instructions-04.png](/jswitch/Assembly_Instructions-04.png)

## Software

Not all mice inputs are recognized as switch buttons on all devices. JerrySwitch works best with software that directly works with or accepts left and/or right click of the mouse.

## The Team

**Sumedh Supe**, Engineer, UX Designer and UX Researcher  
Swati Ramtilak, Bioengineer  
Sehej Jain, Engineer and Researcher  
Ayushi Gupta, Designer and Researcher  

We were mentored throughout the project by Prof. Anil Prabhakar, CREATE Lab(*IIT Madras)* and the team of mentors at Empower 2021. 

## Final Outcomes

We presented the idea to create assistive switches out of already omnipresent hardware by affixing custom encasings/shells that can facilitate clicks with different motions as per the need. The entire solution was presented at the Student Design Challenge of [**Empower 2021 Assistive Technology Conference](https://empower2021.iiitb.ac.in/)** where it won the **First Prize**. 

The design for one of the encasings has been made open-source and is provided on the following [**website.**](https://jerryswitch.github.io/)

> The switches were used for a quiz by students with motor disabilities organised by L&T and Create Lab IIT Madras.
