## Aim

<aside>
üí° Greenhouse Gas Reduction at an Individual Level

</aside>
<br>

## Problem Exploration and Primary Research

The inner fashionistas in us made us reflect upon ourselves and see if our fashion choices were sustainable. This made us realize that most of the fast fashion industry led to tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases. Thus we chose fast fashion and decided to look at solutions that can help us reduce emissions on an individual level.

The first step after identifying the problem that we were going after, it was important to look at the stakeholders involved in the industry.

The major stakeholders that helped influence fast fashion and in-turn were a consumer of fast fashion was the Generation Z. 

## Process

‚òù ***Disclaimer:** Design Thinking is a messy process and not at all linear. You‚Äôll be following the process in a linear way as you read this piece and with the final outcome at each stage. The original experience was more convoluted and involved a lot of reiterations and constant back and forth between different stages of the process.*

The Design Thinking approach was introduced and utilized throughout the timeline of this project. It involved the following stages and we started right at the produce stage with a problem. The problem was Greenhouse gas reduction at an individual level.

## Design Question

> How do we reduce the impact of fast fashion on carbon emissions by helping Gen Z consumers avoid unnecessary purchases in online shopping?
>

## Primary Research

We got up and took our fashionable goggles, and cleaned them up so that we could get some unbiased insights and could look for ourselves in the fast-fashion business. 

We did fieldwork, went to Zara, H&M, GAP, and other fast fashion stores, and just observed people shop.  We also observed participants (who had agreed to let us observe them) shop online to get to know their shopping patterns.

![Untitled](/tsaf/Untitled%204.png)

Through our field observation on online shopping, we also found out that the barrier to purchasing was very minimal. All a person had to do to shop was 

1. Click a picture or any fashion product
2. Search online using an app like Google Lens
3. Find their listing on any fast fashion app
4. Buy it
5. Return it if not preferable

We had insights from the secondary research(down below) and then also proceed to conduct a survey. The survey was released the people of UW. The following insights were found.

- 79.4% of participants buy ***more than two*** pieces of clothing each time
- Purchasing online saves time and other resources
- Most return clothes because the size and style don't fit
- Online return rate > offline return rate

![Some insights from our survey](/tsaf/Untitled%205.png)
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Some insights from our survey</p>

We realized that many people were buying a lot of clothes together at the same time and we used this major insight to design our solution. 

We actually were not able to shadow any people who were shopping since we could not get permission to do so, maybe from the next time we could plan well in advance and request our classmates ahead and see if we could fit our observations with them. 

## Secondary Research

Through our secondary research, we went on to create a map of the entire fast fashion cycle. We identified the major actions that released greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas emissions were majorly in shipping and the convenience provided by online stores to return items for free. The process of even making clothes is very resource-intensive, requiring lots of water and raw material. Recycling material on the other hand also requires a lot of processing and thus releases greenhouse gases. 

## Requirements

![Fashion lifecycle map ](/tsaf/Untitled%206.png)
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">
Fashion lifecycle map </p>


After getting our insights from the primary and secondary research, we created a fashion lifecycle map and identified all the places that led to major carbon emissions. This helped us prioritize requirements for our solution. Since our major aim was to reduce carbon emissions by individuals this helped make many of our **decisions and trade-offs**. 

By this time we already had a basic idea of our solution, an app that can help people style themselves with their existing clothing closet, so that they do not have to buy more clothing. 

The following requirements for the app were identified across the three sectors, Design, Technology and Business.

**Prioritized Design Requirements**
**Design Requirements**

- Reduce return rate (Highest priority because achievable through reduction in over-purchasing and impacts doubly by adding emissions due to shipping)
- Make People feel good and confident (Hard to achieve but they key driver of fast fashion)
- Incentivize People monetarily
- Incentivize People with time (Both required for changing behavior, people buy fast fashion because it saves time and money both)
- Allow people to check quality of clothes at their homes(Key driver of offline world where returns are much less, if we can bring it to online, less return trips possible)
- Allow for viewing more options even offline(another perk of online shopping‚Ä¶ allowing people to save offline while having access to online stuff should make it easier for people to be less wasteful)

**Tech Requirements**

- Study UX of sites (Required for any technological solution to be created for online purchasing)
- Get knowledge of users existing fashion inventory(To build data of pre-exisitng fashion pieces they have to help suggest if they would be over-purchasing)
- Monitor online store carts of people(to see if they are over purchasing)
- Monitor web page non intrusively (So as to give the same feel to the user without affecting their privacy)
- Using existing image search capabilities for offline shopping(image search is fundamental in some instances

**Business Requirements**

- The rate of cloth return versus no return after online purchases in general.
- The material choice of shipping packages, their costs, and their carbon footprint.
- Removal of free shipping/taxation on shipping to combat effects from shipping
- Getting a partner from the high quality/sustainable fashion industry(to create competition and to get support to make the solution viable)
- Getting brands/online sellers to partner to ensure fewer returns(Hardest to do not sure of finding a middle ground for both parties)

From these requirements core tasks were identified,

- I want to know the size and whether the clothes would fit me before I buy.
- I want to manage my closet and not regret buying something.
- I want to know the environmental cost of making an order or return.
- I want to have more buying options than brand new clothes.
- I want to save money by buying more affordable clothes.
- I want to save time by shopping and returning clothes.

## Ideation

We already had a rough idea of what our solution would look like after generating insights from our research. 

We proceeded to go ahead and identify core features of our app. We had brainstorming sessions, that identified core features using the core tasks.

We also used tools like Scenarios and Sketching to see how our prototype user cycle would look like.

## Prototyping and Evaluation

With the final design of the solution in mind, we created a Figma prototype. The reason for using Figma was that it was intuitive and could be adjusted to the users phones.

<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">
Evaluation of the prototype</p>


The prototype was tested with a few users, on their phones. Their feedback was valuable to improve the product. We wanted to understand users' expectations, difficulties, and suggestions on how to improve the application in future iterations in functionality, effectiveness, and raising awareness.

The major improvements suggested by the users as well as realized by the team during the testing were:

- Customize the layout for better familiarity with similarities to stickers in the app like Instagram and Snapchat
- Clarify the carbon emission calculation algorithm, make it more relatable, a normal human would not know what a kilogram of CO2 emissions are
- Add filters that indicate the environmental cost

## Techniques Used

An iterative process of Design Thinking as a whole was used. Brainstorming, Sketching, Affinity Mapping, Prototyping, Surveying, Evaluations and Reflection were amongst some of the techniques used. 

## Reflection

**On the project, methods, project topic and team dynamics**

The team as a whole was pretty functional, everyone had complementary skills that helped ease the pressure off everyone.  Most of the meetings were after class and some remote. Working on documentation remotely allowed us to be flexible. Everyone somehow worked at different timings to cover the documentation and this helped clock in more hours and complete requirements within the required time frame. This was also a lesson that one must trust the teammates for a project to achieve something significant.

The hardest phase of the project had to be finding out the right problem to tackle, because everyone had different opinions and since we had divided the secondary research to cover these parts, it was more difficult to focus on a single problem. We were focusing on the recycling part as well as the purchasing habits of the clothing lifecycle. After realizing that purchasing can affect recycling rates we decided to work on the purchasing aspect of the problem. 

The project as a whole was fun to work on. Although we could not investigate major business requirements at this point of time in the work, we expect more work into the business side to ensure that this product can be launched to the world. 

**On Assumptions and beliefs**

I had initially not expected design thinking to take this so much effort from my side, but having the user in mind all the time requires time to get familiar with the user. This not only requires effort but time as well. 

Initially I had the feeling that the team was going no where with the work, but eventually following the process, doing our own back and forth(I was also surprised to see the amount of iterations used in the process) and proper value to reasoned arguments led us to achieve significant progress.

**Things that went well**

The team was functional, this was the biggest plus point. Everyone was understanding and no one was overbearing. 

We also had the user in mind, our users were accessible to us, our classmates were the Gen Z, this allowed us to be surrounded by our users which led to better collection of data. 

The prototype evaluation session was also well organized.

**Things that can be improved**

Better planning towards meetings would have been beneficial, it would have helped us stay more on time. 

The prototype after feedback can definitely be improved further and can undergo more user testing. 

**On Design Thinking**

Design Thinking as a process was systematic yet a sort of process that can shake the ground beneath you because of the constant iterations and movements between different processes during the entire process.  It was fun to know that you can start on any part of the process and yet be successful if you kept the user in mind. 

It was wonderful to find out how the user was always the center of attention. Throughout the course I also realized the importance of reflection, not only through the amount of times it would be required but the tremendous importance it has on our grades. It definitely did allow me to see the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô for the problems that I was tackling. Reflection would definitely be a part of any work I would do in the future. 

Design Thinking would definitely be a practice I would incorporate to human issues that I would be solving. It does help come up with user insights that would have earlier been rather invisible just because the user has been the center of the process. 

Earlier, googling and just asking people around would have been my way of solving problems that I was facing. It was almost all based on secondary research but now I realize that I am missing out of the fact that the user is around me and needs to be consulted before attempting a solution.

**On Evaluation process**

Users really do click on everything on the prototype. The test participants are in their most natural comfortable state. Although it becomes hard to test the prototype when they would be in a stressful situation.
