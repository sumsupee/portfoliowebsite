## Overview

The project explores different themes to how technology is evolving through various HCI theories. These theories have been supplemented by a song that describe the process and the theories that took me through the class. A handcrafted selection of songs representing my learning about how technology was shaped and how it will be shaped in the future. Created for the general public. 

## **Idea 1: Sociotechnical Theory**

Song: **Disconnect, Clean Bandit (English)**

<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Disconnect, Clean Bandit</p>

The theory refuses to see people and technology as disconnected entities. The theory states strongly against this and states they affect each other and how one interacts with technology has long-standing social and personal effects on the person [1].

I have chosen this song, Disconnect, from one of my favorite bands: Clean Bandit. The first paragraph mentions feeling anxious, not feeling right, staying up all night, and trying to disconnect but not being able to. Social Media which is a form of technology this song tries to reference has been proven to be strongly correlated with anxiety and depression among people. This song through its expression of disconnecting just shows how strongly life today is connected with technology and this line “I can't cut the wires running 'round my head” shows how difficult it is to cut off from technology. Through the line “I've been going through the motions, losing all my drive”, the song conveys the real-life impacts technology has on people [2].

This song is just the perfect example to debunk that technology and people are not disconnected and are instead inseparable in today’s world.


## Idea 2: Busting myths about technology

Song: **Everything at once, Lenka (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eE9tV1WGTgE"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Everything at once, Lenka (English)</p>

This idea was fundamental to us learning about how technology is not what it claims to be. Technology looks grand but it isn’t. Technology looks linear but it isn’t. Technology is not efficient and is fallible. Technology is definitely not apolitical.

Technology is mundane and presents everywhere. Technology is invisible and is more than just a tool. This song to me is about how technology wants to be everything. As fast as a fox, as grand as a whale. The song shows how technology is willing to be everything at once, but at the same time compares it to animals that are fallible creatures. And just by wanting to be everything(or at least being present everywhere) it is deeply ingrained everywhere, and thus political.

Another reason for me to choose this song was that this was used for the Windows 8 commercial where the new windows promised to do everything through its app store and the infamous start screen which was removed from subsequent Windows versions [3][4]. 


## Idea 3: Recognising our differences

Song: **Scars to Your Beautiful, Alessia Cara (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWASeaYuHZo"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Scars to Your Beautiful, Alessia Cara (English)</p>

The theme is about how all of us have inherent differences and we can only truly understand each other only if we experience all of the experiences that the person has been through to understand their viewpoint. By acknowledging our differences we can make the process much easier. Providing an open space for people to do this can help it. This song is about how people are different and should be cherished for who they are on the inside for they bring in so much more. It is a song about love and how people should love themselves(“You should know you're beautiful just the way you are”), people should love their flaws and cherish their imperfections for that is what makes them beautiful. The scars make them beautiful. Through the line, “Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface” the song mentions that differences in the form of beauty are deeply ingrained and inherent. Closing with the last two lines “And you don't have to change a thing, The world could change its heart” it is how technology should be, adapting to users and not the other way around.

## Idea 4: The first connection(internet) and the first message - LO

Song: **Calm Down, Rema (Pidgin English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQLsdm1ZYAw"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Calm Down, Rema (Pidgin English)</p>

Learning about the first connection of the internet was interesting [5]. It talks about how the two computers established a connection and what their first message was. How it was confirmed by having people call over the telephone. The song I have chosen is similar in how the main singer talks about establishing a connection with another human. Both are trying to find a way to communicate, saying to calm down and then make each other feel comfortable. The repeated lyrics mention “Baby come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love” just like how after the connection was established only LO was transferred between UCLA and Stanford.

A phrase in the song mentions ‘can we link up’ which is similar to computers using TCP/IP to form a connection. It also talks about the lockdown, which made internet usage soar during the covid pandemic lockdown [6].

On the whole, the song is about Rema’s success and how he has clarity in his mind. Clarity is what internet protocol these days provides during packet transmission and this song encompasses that.

## Idea 5: Design justice, inclusive design, value-sensitive design, and community-based design

Song: **Hum Hain Happy, 6-pack Band (Hindi-English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/blvOBnSRfVc"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Hum Hain Happy, 6-pack Band (Hindi-English)</p>

Design Justice centers the voices of those who have been historically marginalized, the hijras even though they enjoyed a central position in traditional Hindu customs, with the arrival of the British their existence was criminalized in India and they became marginalized. [7] Sadly, they are still marginalized in India.

The 6-pack band is the world's first all-hijra (transgender) band. Hum Hain Happy is their first song. This song starts by stating how hijras have long been a part of South Asian culture yet are ignored by South Asian society in the present day. The song is about how the Hijra community even after facing these challenges is happy and knows to take care of themselves, by not caring about what others think(“With the air, like I don’t care”). The song also mentions, “Aao bajaao taali” which means come clap with me, in a reference to the hijra clap. The song is by the hijra community for everyone, it centers on them and by using the song Happy(inspired by [Pharell Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM)) they also stay strong to a value-sensitive design by mentioning happiness for uplifting the hijra community and changing their perception amongst the South Asian masses.

## Idea 6: AI, including its history, what it does well, where it falters, and how it perpetuates human biases

Song: **Doraemon Hindi OST Old Version (Hindi Version)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3SIEWrL18E"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Doraemon Hindi OST Old Version (Hindi Version) Laggy video but original song</p>

Doraemon is a cat-robot who comes from the 22nd century into the past. The robot helps children in the past with its futuristic gadgets to solve their problems. The OST of the show is a beautiful song about how much good a robot with artificial intelligence can do in the world. The song begins with ‘Zindagi Sawar dun, ik nayi baahar dun’ which means *I can improve life, give it a new fresh push.* Continuing with ‘Duniya hi badal dun, mai to pyara sa chamatkar hun’ which means *I can change the world, I am a cute miracle*. Both lines are definitely true to how capable AI can be. We have seen it with ChatGPT, it is nothing less than miraculous, enabling people to do whatever they want.

AI can help bring people’s dreams to reality much faster, as has been highlighted in the song ‘Ab ye mera sapna hai ki sab ke sapne sach mai karoon’, which translates to now it is my dream to make others dreams come true. This song personifies AI and shows what it can be capable of at least in the utopian scenario.

## Idea 7: Race, Colonialism and Technology

Song: **Feel it Still, Portugal the man (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBkHHoOIIn8"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Feel it Still, Portugal the man (English)</p>

The idea underlines the need for understanding that racial and colonialist biases have been ingrained in most of the technology around us to this day. These biases have seeped into technology and have discriminatory effects on people of color. Identifying and knowing about them should help us better understand how we can help eliminate them. Technology around us today still has a lot of these biases ingrained in it.

The song ‘Feel it still’ is about rebellion. The line “Ooh, I’m a rebel just for kicks, now” describes how the song is about a rebel who was to challenge the order of biases. Through, “Can’t keep my hands to myself” the song tries to reach out to other people bridging the gap. “Might be over now, but I feel it still” is about how the rebellion is not yet over and the effects can still be felt. It is exactly how ingrained biases can be and be felt for a continued time even after years. Through, “I been feeling it since 1966, now”, the song also highlights how long effects can be continued to be felt, and tech might have changed but the biases still remain impacting people.

## Idea 8: Agnogenesis

Song: **Hot N Cold, Katy Perry (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTHNpusq654"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Hot N Cold, Katy Perry (English)</p>

Ignorance is often looked at as a void of knowledge, but hardly is it looked at as something that can be crafted and created. Ignorance can be created by using the very rules on which knowledge generation depends. Agnogenesis leads to confusion in the general public and is enough to divert attention from the problem [8].

Confusions resulting from ignorance leave the person with no certainty. The issues of global warming and the tobacco industry have all been hot n cold, i.e., both rely on feeling real and unreal at the same. Confusion helps certain players gain an advantage while harming people and the environment at the same time. The line, “We fight, we break up

We kiss, we make up”, is similar to how fake research is produced to counter credible research, adding to the confusion. The line, “Stuck on a roller coaster” also highlights how the impacts are just as rushed as being on a roller coaster, with no insight into what comes ahead.

## Idea 9: Maintenance

Song: **Rockabye, Clean Bandit (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/papuvlVeZg8"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Rockabye, Clean Bandit (English)</p>

Maintenance is a major part of what is being done in technology today. Maintenance helps the technology keep running smoothly but the people who maintain are mostly invisible and have to do all the difficult tasks without any benefits [9]. The song Rockabye is about a single mother who has to take up jobs that are difficult(“She works the night, by the water, She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter...daily struggle”), to create a nice life for her child(“She just wants a life for her baby”).

Here the child can be interpreted as the technology that is around, and the difficult invisible work being done by the mother. This song is about love and love requires maintenance, which requires a lot of effort. This song portrays the efforts that are hidden to make the technology rock(“I’m gonna rock you”). The line, “Nobody matter like you” highlights how tech giants expect people to work continuously for them whilst not treating the maintenance workers with any benefits.

## Idea 10: Reflection

Song: **Never gonna give you up, Rick Astley (English)**

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    frameBorder="0"
    className="w-full h-full"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    style = "position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;";
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-2 text-center">Rockabye, Clean Bandit (English)</p>

This main theme is about ensuring that this knowledge reaches more people, through either creating zines for someone who was not as technologically aware as us or even playlists like these. Looking back at all the lecture slides and getting the course goals engraved, bridging the gap between the social and technical, and breaking open the black box. I decided to never give up these learnings. The song Never gonna give you up is associated with technology([rickrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)), but the lyrics are even more meaningful as I say I do not plan to give up these learnings. Through the line, “A full commitment's what I'm thinking of” the song talks about how committed the person is. The line, “Gotta make you understand” can be interpreted as how these learnings can be further shared to bridge the divide between the technologically aware and the technologically unaware. The song ends with "Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you”, which can be interpreted as I know the amount of power I can wield with technology and how I can use it for creating an equitable society.
